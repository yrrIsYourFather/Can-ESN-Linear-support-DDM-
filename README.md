# PRL: Can Parallel Reservoir Computing with Linear Modules Support DDM?


## Model

## Data

Our dataset is developed on the https://github.com/tyangLab/Sequence_learning, we appreciate this great work! 

You can use it to generate data sets and specify shape sequence for analysis.

## Analysis

[./analysis](/analysis)  and [./fig](/fig) are our codes for model analysis. 

When running the **figD.py** file, you need to specify the generated shape sequence in the **dataset.py**. Other code can run directly.
