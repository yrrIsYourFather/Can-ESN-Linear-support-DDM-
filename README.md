# PRL: Can Parallel Reservoir Computing with Linear Modules Support DDM?


## model

## Data

Our dataset is developed on the https://github.com/tyangLab/Sequence_learning, we appreciate this great work! 

You can use it to generate data sets and specify shape sequence for analysis

## Analysis

./analysis  and ./fig are our codes for mode analysis. 

When running the figD.py file, you need to specify the generated shape sequence in the dataset.py. Other code can run directly
